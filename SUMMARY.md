**FIRE: Fundus Image Registration Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 268 images with 2680 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *reference point* and *test point*.

Images in the FIRE dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 categories: ***S*** (142 images), ***P*** (98 images), and ***A*** (28 images). Additionally, every image grouped with its ***im_id*** tag.
